**Created**: 2026-02-22 Sunday afternoon
**Task**: CSV export for Overview and Explorer views
**Branch**: main (clean, up to date with origin)

## What's Done This Session

1. **Data accuracy audit** — deployed 3 parallel agents to verify all charts/data across Overview, Explorer, and Anomalies views against EDA findings. Result: 66/71 checks passed, 0 critical failures
2. **Fix: May annotation** — added muted "Test Drug / Excluded" annotation on May in Overview monthly chart (default view) and Explorer mini trend
3. **Fix: Intro text assertiveness** — softened Anomalies page intro from asserting Sep/Nov causes as facts to hedging as "consistent with" requiring confirmation
4. **Fix: Sep/Nov comparison bar baseline** — changed `avgByState` and `avgByFormulary` queries from 12-month avg to 9-normal-month avg (excl May/Sep/Nov), matching headline % methodology
5. **Fix: Explorer mini trend toggle-aware** — annotation swaps between "Test Drug Excl." (gray) and "99% Kryptonite" (red) based on flagged NDC toggle
6. **Fix: AI Process stat bar** — corrected specs 5→6, ACs ~65→97, sessions ~8→~10
7. **CSV export plan written** — `docs/plans/2026-02-22-csv-export.md` (Overview + Explorer only, dropped Anomalies)

## Commits This Session (5)

- `0b96604` fix: data accuracy audit — align charts with EDA findings
- `8da5837` fix: add test drug excluded annotation to Explorer mini trend
- `f798bec` fix: make Explorer mini trend annotation toggle-aware
- `e49baf0` fix: correct AI Process stat bar numbers
- (plan file from other machine: `57302df`)

## What's Remaining

- **Implement CSV export** — 4 tasks in `docs/plans/2026-02-22-csv-export.md`:
  1. Write `src/lib/export-csv.ts` utility + tests (TDD)
  2. Add export button to Overview (`src/app/page.tsx`)
  3. Add export button to Explorer (`src/app/explorer/page.tsx`)
  4. Run full test suite + push

## Uncommitted Files

- `docs/plans/2026-02-22-csv-export.md` — detailed implementation plan (untracked, supersedes the earlier `docs/plans/csv-export.md` from other machine)

## Decisions Made This Session

- **Dropped Anomalies CSV export** — narrative text as CSV rows is awkward; Overview + Explorer have the tabular data
- **Subagent-driven execution** chosen over parallel session for CSV export (4 small tasks, no parallelism needed)
- **No changes needed to Anomalies page May annotation** — surrounding narrative already explains Kryptonite exclusion

## Next Action

Implement CSV export using subagent-driven development. Start with Task 1: create `src/lib/export-csv.ts` and `src/lib/__tests__/export-csv.test.ts` following the TDD steps in `docs/plans/2026-02-22-csv-export.md`. The plan has complete code for all 4 tasks.
