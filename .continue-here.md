- **Created**: 2026-02-20 ~10:45 AM CT
- **Task**: Pre-implementation setup — pulled Mac's DX tooling, about to start SPEC-002
- **Branch**: main (1 commit ahead of origin)

## What's Done This Session
- Pulled Mac's `d354ad3` (Prettier, hooks fixes, DX scripts) — rebased local checkpoint on top
- Resolved `.claude/settings.json` merge conflict — Framework Desktop paths with all 4 hooks:
  - PreToolUse: `block-destructive.sh`
  - PostToolUse: `post-edit-format.sh` (Prettier auto-format) + `check-syntax.sh` (TypeScript)
  - Stop: `verify-before-stop.sh`
- Installed Vercel React Best Practices skill globally (`~/.agents/skills/vercel-react-best-practices`)
- Added Vercel MCP server to `~/.claude.json` project config (needs session restart to activate)

## What's Remaining
- Implement SPEC-002: FilterContext + FilterBar + URL sync + chip pills
- Implement SPEC-003: Executive Overview page
- Implement SPEC-004: Claims Explorer page
- Install missing shadcn components: `npx shadcn@latest add command popover switch skeleton`
- Cross-filtering + reference lines on hero chart

## In-Progress State
- `.claude/settings.json` staged (conflict resolved, Framework paths with post-edit-format hook added)
- `docs/plans/2026-02-20-spec-001-api-routes.md` untracked (old SPEC-001 plan, can commit or leave)
- Vercel MCP configured but requires session restart to appear in `/mcp`
- Dev server not running

## Decisions Made This Session
- **Merge conflict resolution**: Mac's commit had Mac paths (`/Users/danswensen/Desktop/...`), local stash had Framework paths (`/home/danswensen/...`). Resolved by using `git checkout --theirs` for the stash version (Framework paths) then manually re-adding the `post-edit-format.sh` hook entry that Mac introduced.
- **Vercel MCP**: Added via `claude mcp add vercel -- npx -y @vercel/mcp@latest`. Saved to user-level `~/.claude.json` under project config. Won't activate until session restart.

## Next Action
Restart Claude Code session to activate Vercel MCP. Then read SPEC-002 (`docs/specs/SPEC-002-filter-context.md`), run `/spec-check 002` if not already verified, write implementation plan, and start building. First file: FilterContext provider (`src/contexts/filter-context.tsx`).
