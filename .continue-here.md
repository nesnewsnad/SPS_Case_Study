**Created**: 2026-02-21 Saturday evening
**Task**: All implementation complete. Submission ready.
**Branch**: main (clean, up to date with origin)

## What's Done This Session

1. **Process page hero reframe** — subtitle, hook paragraph, and closing paragraph rewritten to lead with SPS Health business value ("same system, ready to deploy across your analytics practice") and close with specific department use cases (pricing, network adequacy, clinical utilization, client onboarding)
2. **Follow-up questions reframe** — 6 questions rewritten from hedging to ownership. Each question now demonstrates the finding and asks for confirmation, not discovery. Still framed as questions per the brief's deliverable requirement.
3. **Submission email draft** — saved to `docs/submission-email.md`, points evaluator to Anomalies page first (Kryptonite tease) then Process page
4. **Competitive assessment** — audited against brief requirements and reverse-engineered likely grading rubric. Kryptonite XR is the sorting hat. All four gates covered.
5. **Checkpoint cleanup** — removed previous `.continue-here.md`
