**Created**: 2026-02-20 ~16:30 EST
**Task**: Chat sidebar ("Ask the Data") — research phase, about to start implementation
**Branch**: main

## What's Done This Session

- Pulled latest from origin (SPEC-006 spec + context docs from Mac)
- Implemented SPEC-006: AI Process page (7 files, 511 lines)
  - `stat-bar.tsx` — 5 hero stat pills
  - `pipeline-flow.tsx` — 5-stage pipeline with chevron connectors, teal gradient
  - `context-layer.tsx` — 3 context management cards
  - `artifact-evidence.tsx` — 4 proof cards with monospace excerpts, before/after, commit table
  - `toolkit.tsx` — enterprise framing + Streamlit contrast + 6 tool cards
  - `limitations.tsx` — 4 amber-bordered limitation cards
  - `page.tsx` — main page assembling all 5 sections
- Build passes clean, pushed to origin/main
- SPEC-005 verified PASS 14/14 (by Mac)
- SPEC-006 verified PASS 14/14 (by Mac)
- Updated TODO.md — all 4 deliverables complete
- Reviewed case study requirements — all 4 deliverables and 3 scoring axes covered
- User installed `frontend-design` plugin for chat sidebar UI work

## What's Remaining

1. **"Ask the Data" chat sidebar** — `/api/chat` route, Chat UI, streaming, ANTHROPIC_API_KEY
2. **Enterprise polish pass** — colors, spacing, typography, hover states, transitions
3. **Final QA + deploy + submit**

## In-Progress State

- Clean working tree — all changes committed and pushed
- `docs/plans/2026-02-20-spec-001-api-routes.md` is untracked (from Mac, not implementation-relevant)
- `frontend-design` plugin just installed — user needs to restart Claude Code to load it
- No spec written for chat sidebar yet — TODO.md has bullet points but no formal spec
- ANTHROPIC_API_KEY needs to be set in Vercel env vars before chat works in production

## Decisions Made This Session

- SPEC-006 implemented as fully static server component — no 'use client', no API calls
- Used ChevronRight from lucide-react for pipeline connectors (consulting-deck aesthetic)
- Teal gradient: teal-50 → teal-100 → teal-200 → teal-400 → teal-600 for pipeline stages
- Artifact evidence uses Card wrapper + monospace inner content (`.md-in-a-terminal` aesthetic)
- Before/after comparison uses red-50/teal-50 tinted columns
- Amber left-border accent (border-l-4 border-amber-400) for limitation cards

## Next Action

1. Restart Claude Code to load the `frontend-design` plugin
2. Research chat UI approach: likely Vercel AI SDK (`ai` package) with `useChat` hook + Anthropic provider, or raw streaming with shadcn Sheet component
3. Implement `/api/chat` route with Anthropic Claude API, system prompt containing key data findings from CLAUDE.md
4. Build chat UI component — likely a slide-out Sheet from the sidebar with message list + input
