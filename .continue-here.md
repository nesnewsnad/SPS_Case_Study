# Continue Here

**Created**: 2026-02-22 Sunday evening
**Task**: Final polish complete — ready for Monday submission
**Branch**: main (clean, up to date with origin)

## What's Done This Session

1. **CSV export utility** — `src/lib/export-csv.ts` with 6 tests (TDD), `downloadCsv()` browser trigger
2. **CSV export on Overview** — Export button in header, 5-section CSV (KPIs, monthly, formulary, state, adjudication)
3. **CSV export on Explorer** — Export button in header, 7-section CSV (KPIs, monthly, drugs, days supply, MONY, groups, manufacturers)
4. **AI process context in chat** — Added process layer to system prompt so chat can answer "how was this built?" questions (pipeline, tech stack, limitations)
5. **Markdown header rendering in chat** — `##` headers now render as semibold text instead of literal `##`
6. **Route-specific loading skeletons** — Explorer, Anomalies, Process each have their own loading.tsx matching page layout
7. **Descriptive CSV headers** — "Month (YYYY-MM)", "Incurred Claims", "Reversal Rate (%)", etc.
8. **Chat error retry** — "Retry last message" link in error state
9. **Test count in README** — 112 TypeScript + 69 Python

## Project Status

**Feature complete. All polish applied. Ready for Monday submission.**

- 4 dashboard views: Overview, Explorer, Anomalies, AI Process
- "Ask the Data" chat with data + process context
- CSV exports on Overview and Explorer
- 112 Vitest + 69 pytest = 181 total tests
- All tests passing, build clean, deployed to Vercel

## What's Remaining

- **Monday**: Final manual QA walkthrough on live site, then submit
- No code changes planned unless QA finds a bug

## Decisions Made This Session

- **Dropped Anomalies CSV export** — narrative text as CSV rows is awkward; Overview + Explorer cover the tabular data
- **Reset Filters button already existed** — "Clear all" ghost button in chip pills row
- **Esc to close chat already worked** — Radix Sheet handles it by default
- **Shared git repo with submission** — commit history proves the process is real

## Next Action

Monday morning: manual QA on deployed site (all 4 views, filters, chat, CSV exports), then submit.
