# Continue Here

**Created**: 2026-02-21 ~afternoon EST (Framework Desktop)
**Task**: Narrative enrichment — brainstorm complete, design + plan written, ready to implement
**Branch**: main (clean, up to date with origin)

## What's Done This Session

1. **Honest audit of dashboard** — identified Data Storytelling as the weakest scoring axis
2. **COVID-19 / LTC 2021 research** — comprehensive findings on Delta wave, Great Resignation, CMS vaccine mandate, booster rollout, Omicron emergence, state-specific impacts
3. **Brainstorm session** — 3 decisions locked:
   - **Placement**: Enrich existing panels (no new UI)
   - **Tone**: Hypothesis framing (present COVID as plausible context, acknowledge semi-synthetic caveat)
   - **Scope**: Anomaly panels + follow-up questions only (overview/explorer insights unchanged)
4. **Design doc written**: `docs/plans/2026-02-21-narrative-enrichment-design.md`
5. **Implementation plan written**: `docs/plans/2026-02-21-narrative-enrichment-plan.md` — 8 tasks
6. **Committed and pushed** to origin/main

## Decisions Made This Session

- Synthesis block goes at top of Investigation Panels section — ties all 6 findings into one narrative
- COVID context uses hypothesis framing: "In a real LTC pharmacy portfolio, this is consistent with..." + "However, the perfect uniformity is atypical... consistent with semi-synthetic data"
- Pharmacy A's fundamentals are SOUND — the synthesis says "everything else here is actionable today"
- No new UI components — all changes are string literal replacements + one `<p>` element

## What's Remaining — Implementation (8 tasks)

1. **Task 1**: Add synthesis block to `src/app/anomalies/page.tsx` (new `<p>` between section header and panels)
2. **Task 2**: Enrich Panel 1 (Kryptonite XR) — whyItMatters + rfpImpact
3. **Task 3**: Enrich Panel 2 (KS August) — whyItMatters + toConfirm + rfpImpact
4. **Task 4**: Enrich Panel 3 (September Spike) — whyItMatters + toConfirm + rfpImpact (uses template literals for dynamic values)
5. **Task 5**: Enrich Panel 4 (November Dip) — whyItMatters IIFE + toConfirm + rfpImpact
6. **Task 6**: Enrich Panels 5-6 (Cycle Fill + Semi-Synthetic) — minor enrichments
7. **Task 7**: Enrich follow-up questions — COVID context on September and November questions
8. **Task 8**: Final verification — build + tsc + lint

All exact find/replace strings are in the plan doc. No ambiguity.

## Files to Change

- `src/app/api/anomalies/route.ts` — 12 string literal replacements across 6 panels
- `src/app/anomalies/page.tsx` — 1 new synthesis paragraph element
- `src/components/anomalies/follow-up-questions.tsx` — 2 context string appends

## Next Action

Execute the 8-task implementation plan. All string replacements, no logic changes. Can be done directly or via subagent-driven development.
