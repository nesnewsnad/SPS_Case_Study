**Created:** 2026-02-19 18:30
**Task:** Project workflow setup + pre-spec design phase
**Branch:** main

## What's Done
- Initialized git repo with full project workflow
- Created CLAUDE.md with project context, data dictionary, EDA findings, tech stack decisions
- Created TODO.md with full deliverable checklist (SPEC-001 through SPEC-009 + final polish)
- Created docs/WORKFLOW.md defining artifact chain, dual-machine model, session discipline
- Created docs/specs/SPEC-PROCESS.md with GSD-enhanced verification methodology
- Created 7 skills in .claude/skills/ (open-session, close-session, continue-here, discuss, research, spec-check, verify)
- Created 7 slash commands in .claude/commands/ (same 7, accessible via /project:<name>)
- Created 3 hooks in .claude/hooks/ (block-destructive, check-syntax, verify-before-stop)
- Wired hooks in .claude/settings.json
- Completed initial EDA of both datasets:
  - Claims: 596K rows, 5 states, 189 groups, 100% retail, 3 formularies
  - Drug Info: 247K rows, 99.5% NDC match, 2,421 manufacturers, 37,531 drug names
  - Key findings: Sept spike, Nov dip, KS reversal anomaly, 75% non-adjudicated
- Reviewed Framework_Build workflow system and GSD (get-shit-done) framework
- Designed hybrid workflow: Framework_Build base + 3 GSD enhancements (discuss, research, goal-backward verify)

## What's Remaining
- Run `/project:discuss` to lock dashboard architecture decisions (layout, charts, interactions, narrative structure, color palette)
- Run `/project:research` to investigate Chart.js capabilities, LTC dashboard best practices, data cardinalities for filter design
- Write SPEC-001 through SPEC-009
- Implement all specs
- Verify all specs
- Deploy dashboard

## In-Progress State
- No specs written yet — still in pre-spec phase
- No implementation code yet
- Workflow is fully operational, ready for the discuss → research → spec → implement → verify cycle
- Remote not set up yet (no push target)

## Decisions Made This Session
- **Tech stack**: Single self-contained HTML file with Chart.js (no build step, no server, opens in any browser)
- **Workflow**: Hybrid of Framework_Build (artifact chain, skills, hooks, dual-machine) + GSD (discuss phase, research phase, goal-backward verification)
- **Spec breakdown**: 9 specs covering data pipeline, layout, utilization view, drill-downs, trends, narrative, follow-ups, mock-up extension, AI process docs
- **Hooks adapted for HTML/JS**: check-syntax uses node --check for JS, py_compile for Python, json module for JSON (not ruff since this isn't primarily Python)

## Next Action
**Priority 1:** Run `/project:discuss` targeting the overall dashboard architecture. Specifically: present gray areas around (1) tab-based vs. scroll-based layout, (2) chart types for monthly trend vs. distribution views, (3) filter bar placement and cross-filtering behavior, (4) narrative annotation style (inline callouts vs. separate insight cards), (5) color palette for the 3 formulary types + 4 MONY categories. Lock these decisions into `docs/specs/dashboard-architecture-context.md` before writing any specs.
