**Created**: 2026-02-20 ~23:30 EST (Framework Desktop)
**Task**: AI Process page redesign — interactive 7-stage walkthrough
**Branch**: main (2 unpushed commits: design doc + implementation plan)

## What's Done This Session

1. **Filter bar redesign** — committed + pushed (`fbd292b`). Added "Dimensions" / "Drill Down" group labels, border separator between filter groups, contained amber pill for flagged NDC toggle.
2. **Brainstorming** — full design session for AI Process page redesign. Narrative arc: proof → system → vision. 7-stage pipeline (Research → Discuss → Spec → Spec-Check → Implement → Verify → Ship). Interactive side-by-side walkthrough tracing SPEC-005 through all stages.
3. **Design doc written** — `docs/plans/2026-02-20-process-page-design.md` (committed `a0e4b71`)
4. **Implementation plan written** — `docs/plans/2026-02-20-process-page-plan.md` (committed `d68788f`)

## What's Remaining

**5 implementation tasks from the plan (`docs/plans/2026-02-20-process-page-plan.md`):**

1. **Task 1: Expand PipelineFlow to 7 stages** — Modify `src/components/process/pipeline-flow.tsx`. Add Discuss (stage 2) and Ship (stage 7). Redistribute teal gradient. Reduce min-widths to fit 7 cards (`min-w-[160px]`, `md:min-w-[140px]`).
2. **Task 2: Create PipelineWalkthrough component** — New file `src/components/process/pipeline-walkthrough.tsx`. Client component with useState. Side-by-side layout (stage list left, content right). 7 stages with principle/moment/artifact/callout per stage. All narrative text and artifact content defined in the plan.
3. **Task 3: Rewrite page.tsx** — Modify `src/app/process/page.tsx`. New headline/subline/hook paragraph. Replace ArtifactEvidence with PipelineWalkthrough. Move ContextLayer below walkthrough. Add closing section.
4. **Task 4: Remove ArtifactEvidence** — Delete `src/components/process/artifact-evidence.tsx` (absorbed into walkthrough).
5. **Task 5: Visual QA + push**

**Other enhancement items still pending (from earlier checkpoint):**

- Glossary tooltips
- CSV export on drugs table
- Anomalies info banner
- Drug drill-down modal

## Decisions Made This Session

- **7 stages, not 5** — Add Discuss (design decision locking before specs) and Ship (session continuity, cyclical process). Research comes first, not Discuss.
- **Side-by-side walkthrough UX** — stages left, content right. Mirrors dashboard interaction model. Non-linear access for busy evaluators. Mobile: horizontal tabs above content.
- **SPEC-005 as protagonist** — Most analytically impressive feature. Has real artifacts at every pipeline stage.
- **Three-layer content per stage** — Principle (transferable rule), SPEC-005 Moment (concrete proof), Artifact (real evidence), Callout (takeaway).
- **Merge artifacts into walkthrough** — Artifacts become proof inside the system, not a disconnected appendix section.
- **Narrative arc: proof → system → vision** — Open with findings (stakes), show the system (how), close with forward-looking framing (transferable).

## Next Action

Start executing `docs/plans/2026-02-20-process-page-plan.md`, Task 1. Open `src/components/process/pipeline-flow.tsx` and replace the 5-stage `stages` array with the 7-stage version from the plan. Reduce `min-w-[200px]` to `min-w-[160px]` and `md:min-w-[180px]` to `md:min-w-[140px]`. Build-verify with `npx next build`.

User was asked whether to use subagent-driven or parallel session execution but ran /continue-here before answering — ask again on resume.
