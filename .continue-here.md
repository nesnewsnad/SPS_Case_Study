**Created**: 2026-02-21 ~late afternoon EST (Framework Desktop)
**Task**: Narrative enrichment complete, chat bug fixed, competitive assessment done
**Branch**: main (clean, up to date with origin)

## What's Done This Session

1. **Executed 9-task narrative enrichment plan** — all string replacements + recommendation block
   - Task 1: Synthesis block added to anomalies page (paragraph above investigation panels)
   - Tasks 2-6: Enriched all 6 anomaly panel narratives with COVID context, business impact, hypothesis framing
   - Task 7: Added COVID context to September and November follow-up questions
   - Task 8: Build + typecheck + lint verification (all pass, no new errors)
   - Task 9: Three-tier recommendation block (green/yellow/red) between panels and follow-up questions
2. **Fixed chat multi-turn bug** — `convertToModelMessages` requires `parts` on every message, but assistant messages from history only had `content`. Added `ensureParts()` preprocessor and made `content` optional in Zod schema.
3. **Added COVID context to chat system prompt** — Delta wave, Great Resignation, CMS vaccine mandate, Omicron, PBM COVID-audit context in anomaly sections
4. **Competitive assessment** — audited dashboard against job description (AI Implementation Intern). Scores: AI Proficiency 9.5/10, Data Storytelling 9/10, Dashboard Design 9/10. Top 20% estimate.

## Commits This Session (4 narrative + 1 bugfix + 1 chat context)

- `ea99ad6` feat: add COVID-19 / LTC 2021 context to chat system prompt
- `17ab838` fix: chat crashes on multi-turn conversations
- `0a062d7` chore: remove checkpoint file after narrative enrichment complete
- `306dd5e` feat: add three-tier recommendation block to anomalies page
- `464cea9` feat: add synthesis block to anomalies page
- (+ 2 more: API route narratives, follow-up questions)

## Decisions Made This Session

- Recommendation block uses green/yellow/red traffic-light pattern — evaluator-friendly
- COVID framing uses hypothesis language ("consistent with...") + semi-synthetic caveat throughout
- Chat bug was AI SDK v6 breaking change — `convertToModelMessages` requires `parts` arrays, not `content` strings
- Vercel deployment-specific URLs have auth protection (SSO wall) — production URL works fine

## High-Impact Improvements Identified (Not Yet Done)

1. **Reframe Process page hero** (30 min) — open with business value, connect pipeline to "how I'd implement AI across SPS Health departments"
2. **Reframe follow-up questions from hedging to ownership** (45 min) — flip from "is this a test?" to "this is a test, confirm exclusion"
3. **Skip semi-synthetic visualization** — not relevant to the AI Implementation Intern role

## Next Action

If continuing polish work: Start with Process page hero rewrite — edit `src/app/process/page.tsx`, find the hero/intro section, add business-value framing that connects the pipeline methodology to the actual job (cross-functional AI implementation at SPS Health). This is the highest-impact remaining change for the role.

If submitting: Dashboard is submission-ready. All views functional, all narratives enriched, chat working, deployed at sps-case-study.vercel.app.
