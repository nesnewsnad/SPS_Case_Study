**Subject:** Case Study Submission — Dan Swensen

Hi [Name],

Here's my case study submission:

**[sps-case-study.vercel.app](https://sps-case-study.vercel.app)**

The dashboard has four pages covering all four deliverables:

- **Executive Overview** — KPIs, monthly trends, and cross-filtering (click any chart element to drill down)
- **Claims Explorer** — drug, manufacturer, and group-level analysis with searchable filters
- **Anomalies & Recommendations** — four data anomalies with investigation panels, follow-up questions, and extension mock-ups
- **AI Process** — how the system works, with real artifacts from each stage of the build

I'd recommend starting with the **Anomalies page** — there's a deliberate surprise in the dataset that drove a lot of the analysis. The **AI Process page** documents the engineering discipline behind it, not just which tools I used.

There's also an **"Ask the Data" button** in the bottom-right corner on every page. It's a context-aware AI chat that knows the findings and responds to whatever filters you have active.

The full codebase, specs, and session logs are on GitHub: **[github.com/nesnewsnad/SPS_Case_Study](https://github.com/nesnewsnad/SPS_Case_Study)**

Thank you for the opportunity. I enjoyed the dataset.

Dan
