## Session 2 (Mac — evening)

### Goals

- Final audit against case study requirements
- Polish pass on visual inconsistencies

### Accomplishments

- Comprehensive audit of all 4 deliverables against case study brief — 100% requirements coverage confirmed
- Evaluated all 3 scoring axes (AI Proficiency, Data Storytelling, Dashboard Design) — strong across all
- Identified and dismissed 3/4 potential gaps as reaching (cost analysis, adjudication depth, drug therapy context)
- Removed redundant closing section from AI Process page — page now ends on Honest Limitations (stronger close, hero already carries the "this system transfers" message)
- Fixed inconsistent KPI formatting: Net Claims showed "428K" while Total Claims showed "546,523" — both now use full comma-separated numbers
- Fixed September by Formulary mini chart: was stacked-bar (September on top of average = meaningless), changed to grouped-bar (side-by-side comparison, matches September by State chart)
- Drafted submission email reviewed and approved
- Decision: submit Monday AM (signals confidence, not last-minute)
- Decision: keep "four days" on AI Process page (matches commit history, honesty over optics)

### Files Changed

- `src/app/process/page.tsx` — removed redundant closing section (12 lines)
- `src/app/page.tsx` — Net Claims KPI: `abbreviateNumber` → `formatNumber`
- `src/app/api/anomalies/route.ts` — September formulary chart: `stacked-bar` → `grouped-bar`
- `.continue-here.md` — deleted (checkpoint resolved)

### Commits

- `ea5f489` chore: remove redundant closing section from AI Process page
- `f87720d` fix: use consistent number formatting for overview KPIs
- `4718ea6` fix: change September formulary chart from stacked to grouped bar

### Next Steps

- Monday AM: warm the Vercel edge cache (click all 4 tabs), then send submission email
- Fill in `[Name]` in docs/submission-email.md before sending
- No more code changes — the dashboard is done

## Session 3 (Mac — night)

### Goals

- Open session, sync with remote
- Clean up stale checkpoint file

### Accomplishments

- Deleted stale `.continue-here.md` (was from between Session 1 and 2, already resolved)
- Pulled remote changes with rebase — resolved modify/delete conflict on `.continue-here.md`
- Synced two commits from remote: `078634d` (submission checkpoint), `570260c` (platform vision pipeline replacing extension mock-ups)
- Reviewed platform vision placement on Anomalies & Recommendations page — fits naturally as capstone after Investigation Panels → Recommendation → Follow-Up Questions → Platform Vision

### Files Changed

- `.continue-here.md` — deleted

### Commits

- `0f0a8b6` chore: delete stale checkpoint file

### Next Steps

- Monday AM: warm the Vercel edge cache (click all 4 tabs), then send submission email
