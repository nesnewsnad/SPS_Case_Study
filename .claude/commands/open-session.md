Start a new coding session. Check for `.continue-here.md` checkpoint first — if found, read it, present state summary, ask to resume, then delete it. If no checkpoint, find the latest session log in `docs/sessions/` and summarize what was accomplished and what's next. Also read TODO.md for current priorities and CLAUDE.md for project context. Report 3-5 bullet points max, end with "Ready to work on [next TODO item]?"
