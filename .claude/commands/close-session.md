End this coding session. Create a session log at `docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md` with sections: Goals, Accomplishments (with specific file names, spec numbers, commit hashes), Files Changed, Commits, Next Steps (specific actions, not vague). If the file already exists (multiple sessions today), append a new section header (## Session 2). Then: `git add docs/sessions/YYYY-MM-DD.md && git commit -m "Add session log for YYYY-MM-DD"` then `git push` then verify with `git status`. Never skip the session log. Never leave unpushed commits. You must push — don't say "ready when you are."
