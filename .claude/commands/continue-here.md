Create a mid-session checkpoint. Check git state (status, diff --stat, log --oneline -5). Write `.continue-here.md` in repo root with: Created (date/time), Task (spec number/description), Branch, What's Done, What's Remaining, In-Progress State, Decisions Made This Session (especially failed approaches and why), Next Action (MUST be specific — exact file, exact function, exact line if applicable). Then `git add .continue-here.md && git commit -m "checkpoint: <brief description>"`. Do NOT push. Be specific in Next Action — "continue implementing filters" is BAD. "Add state filter dropdown to filterBar div in index.html, wire to updateCharts() function" is GOOD.
